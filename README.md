# covid-19-tracker
 #A COVID-19 tracker website using HTML, CSS, Django, Python, and SQLite would typically involve the following components:

Frontend (HTML & CSS):

HTML: Used to structure the web pages, including the main dashboard, data tables, charts, and other interactive elements.
CSS: Used to style the website, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap may be used for quicker development.
Backend (Django & Python):

Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django handles the backend logic, URL routing, views, and templates.
Python: Used to write server-side logic, fetch and process COVID-19 data from various APIs, and handle database operations.
Database (SQLite):

SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database that Django supports by default. It's used to store and manage COVID-19 related data, including case numbers, vaccination rates, and other relevant statistics.
Functionality:

Data Retrieval: The site would fetch real-time data from APIs or web scraping tools.
Data Representation: Data is visualized using charts and graphs for easy understanding. Libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib can be used in conjunction with Django.
User Interface: Features include searchable and filterable data tables, interactive maps, and trend analysis over time.
Such a website would provide users with up-to-date information on the COVID-19 situation, enhancing public awareness and aiding in the tracking of the pandemic's progression.
